## How It Works

The app contains a comprehensive database of all disease symptoms from the RuneScape Wiki. When you examine an animal's body parts (head, eyes, legs/feet, stomach), the game provides specific text descriptions. The app matches these descriptions against the known symptoms to identify the correct disease.
